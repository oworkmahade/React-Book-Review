## 📖 About This Project

**Book Vibe** is a React-based book tracking website where users can explore books, mark them as *Read* or *Wishlist*, and visualize their reading progress using a **custom shape bar chart**. The application is built with modern React tools and focuses on clean UI, smooth routing, and meaningful user interaction.
